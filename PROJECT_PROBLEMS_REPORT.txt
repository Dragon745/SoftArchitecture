SOFTARCHITECTURE PROJECT - COMPREHENSIVE PROBLEMS REPORT
========================================================

Generated on: $(Get-Date)
Project: SoftArchitecture - Project Manager
Framework: .NET 8.0 WPF Application

CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEMS
================================

1. VIOLATION OF SEPARATION OF CONCERNS
   - MainWindow.xaml.cs contains 1000+ lines of code mixing UI logic, business logic, and data access
   - All wrapper classes (TaskWrapper, CollectionWrapper, FieldWrapper, TreeNodeItem) are defined in MainWindow.xaml.cs instead of separate files
   - Business logic is tightly coupled with UI code
   - No clear separation between presentation, business, and data layers

2. MISSING MVVM PATTERN IMPLEMENTATION
   - No ViewModels directory usage - ViewModels folder exists but is empty
   - Code-behind contains all business logic instead of ViewModels
   - Direct manipulation of UI elements from code-behind
   - No proper data binding architecture
   - Missing Command pattern for UI actions

3. POOR ERROR HANDLING
   - Inconsistent error handling across the application
   - Some methods silently catch exceptions and only log to Debug.WriteLine
   - MessageBox.Show used directly in service layer (ProjectDataService.cs line 29)
   - No centralized error handling strategy
   - Missing try-catch blocks in critical operations

4. HARDCODED VALUES AND MAGIC STRINGS
   - Hardcoded file paths throughout the codebase
   - Magic strings for UI text and messages
   - Hardcoded styling values in XAML
   - No configuration management system
   - Constants scattered throughout code instead of centralized

CODE QUALITY ISSUES
===================

5. CODE DUPLICATION
   - Multiple wrapper classes with identical INotifyPropertyChanged implementation
   - Repeated SetProperty methods across different classes
   - Duplicate styling patterns in XAML
   - Similar error handling patterns repeated

6. POOR NAMING CONVENTIONS
   - Inconsistent naming: "SoftArchitecture.Models.Task" vs "TaskWrapper"
   - Hungarian notation mixed with modern C# conventions
   - Unclear variable names like "_currentProjectPath"
   - Method names don't clearly indicate their purpose

7. MISSING DOCUMENTATION
   - No XML documentation for public methods and properties
   - Missing code comments explaining complex logic
   - No architectural documentation
   - README.md lacks technical implementation details

8. INEFFICIENT DATA STRUCTURES
   - Using Dictionary<string, string> for FilesToEdit and FilesToCreate instead of proper models
   - ObservableCollection used without proper change notifications
   - No data validation on model properties
   - Missing data annotations for validation

PROJECT STRUCTURE PROBLEMS
==========================

9. INCORRECT PROJECT ORGANIZATION
   - Wrapper classes should be in separate files, not in MainWindow.xaml.cs
   - Services folder exists but services are too simple and don't follow proper patterns
   - Models folder structure is basic and missing important models
   - No proper folder structure for different types of components

10. MISSING DEPENDENCY INJECTION
    - No DI container usage
    - Hard dependencies on concrete classes
    - Services instantiated directly instead of injected
    - Makes testing difficult and violates SOLID principles

11. INCONSISTENT FILE ORGANIZATION
    - Sample data files duplicated in multiple locations
    - No clear separation between development and production files
    - Missing proper build configurations
    - AssemblyInfo.cs contains only theme information

PERFORMANCE AND SCALABILITY ISSUES
==================================

12. SYNCHRONOUS FILE OPERATIONS
    - File operations performed on UI thread
    - No async/await pattern properly implemented
    - Blocking operations that can freeze UI
    - Missing progress indicators for long operations

13. MEMORY MANAGEMENT ISSUES
    - No proper disposal of resources
    - Potential memory leaks with event handlers
    - Large objects held in memory unnecessarily
    - No cleanup of temporary objects

14. INEFFICIENT UI UPDATES
    - Direct UI manipulation instead of data binding
    - No virtualization for large lists
    - Excessive UI updates on data changes
    - Missing UI optimization techniques

SECURITY VULNERABILITIES
========================

15. FILE SYSTEM SECURITY
    - No validation of file paths before operations
    - Potential path traversal vulnerabilities
    - No file type validation
    - Missing file access permissions checking

16. DATA VALIDATION MISSING
    - No input validation on user data
    - JSON deserialization without validation
    - Missing sanitization of user inputs
    - No data integrity checks

TESTING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
=============================

17. NO UNIT TESTS
    - SoftArchitecture.Tests folder exists but appears empty
    - No test coverage for any functionality
    - No integration tests
    - No automated testing pipeline

18. NO CODE ANALYSIS
    - Missing static code analysis tools
    - No code quality metrics
    - No automated code review
    - Missing linting rules

DEPLOYMENT AND CONFIGURATION ISSUES
===================================

19. CLICKONCE DEPLOYMENT PROBLEMS
    - Complex ClickOnce configuration
    - Version management issues (version 1.0.0.1 in csproj vs 1.0.0.2 in publish)
    - Missing proper deployment documentation
    - No rollback strategy

20. MISSING CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
    - Hardcoded settings throughout application
    - No app.config or appsettings.json usage
    - Settings stored in JSON file but not properly managed
    - Missing environment-specific configurations

21. GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOW ISSUES
    - Release workflow depends on external tools (gh CLI)
    - No proper build validation before release
    - Missing automated testing in CI/CD
    - No proper versioning strategy

USER EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS
========================

22. POOR ERROR MESSAGES

    - No user-friendly error recovery
    - Missing validation feedback
    - No help system or documentation

23. ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES

24. INTERNATIONALIZATION MISSING
    - All text hardcoded in English
    - No localization support
    - No culture-specific formatting
    - Missing resource files for translations

MAINTENANCE AND EXTENSIBILITY ISSUES
====================================

25. TIGHT COUPLING
    - Classes tightly coupled making changes difficult
