DETAILED ANALYSIS BY FILE
=========================

1. MAINWINDOW.XAML.CS (Most Critical - 15 instances)
=====================================================

Line 291: private const string SETTINGS_FILE = "settings.json";
WHY HARDCODED: Settings filename hardcoded as constant
IMPACT: Makes it difficult to change settings file location or name
RECOMMENDATION: Move to configuration file or app settings

Line 322: string settingsPath = IOPath.Combine(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory, SETTINGS_FILE);
WHY HARDCODED: Uses AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory for settings location
IMPACT: Settings always stored in application directory, not user-specific
RECOMMENDATION: Use Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData)

Line 323: if (File.Exists(settingsPath))
WHY HARDCODED: Direct file existence check without validation
IMPACT: No path validation before file operations
RECOMMENDATION: Add path validation and error handling

Line 325: string jsonContent = File.ReadAllText(settingsPath);
WHY HARDCODED: Direct file read without error handling
IMPACT: Potential security vulnerability if path is manipulated
RECOMMENDATION: Add file access validation and error handling

Line 349: string settingsPath = IOPath.Combine(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory, SETTINGS_FILE);
WHY HARDCODED: Duplicate path construction for settings file
IMPACT: Code duplication and maintenance issues

CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION
=============================================

1. SECURITY VULNERABILITIES
   - File paths constructed without validation (Lines 322, 349, 363, 523, 524, 586, 1027)
   - Direct file operations without path sanitization
   - Potential path traversal attacks

2. MAINTAINABILITY ISSUES
   - Hardcoded filenames throughout codebase
   - No configuration management for file paths
   - Code duplication in path construction

3. LOCALIZATION ISSUES
   - All UI text hardcoded in English
   - File references in user messages hardcoded
   - No resource file usage

RECOMMENDATIONS BY PRIORITY
===========================

CRITICAL PRIORITY (Fix Immediately):
1. Add path validation before all file operations
2. Implement proper error handling for file operations
3. Use Environment.GetFolderPath for user-specific directories
4. Add input sanitization for file paths

HIGH PRIORITY (Fix Soon):
1. Create configuration management system
2. Extract hardcoded paths to configuration files
3. Implement resource files for UI text
4. Create helper methods for path construction

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Fix When Possible):
1. Refactor duplicate path construction code
2. Add logging for file operations
3. Implement proper exception handling
4. Create constants file for file-related constants

LOW PRIORITY (Future Improvements):
1. Add support for different file formats
2. Implement plugin system for file handling
3. Add configuration UI for path settings
4. Create automated testing for file operations

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
=======================

Phase 1 - Security Fixes:
- Add Path.GetFullPath() validation
- Implement proper exception handling
- Add file access permissions checking

Phase 2 - Configuration Management:
- Create appsettings.json for configuration
- Implement IConfiguration pattern
- Add environment-specific settings

Phase 3 - Code Refactoring:
- Extract path construction to helper methods
- Create constants file for file-related values
- Implement proper logging

Phase 4 - Localization:
- Create resource files for UI text
- Implement localization framework
- Add culture-specific formatting

This analysis reveals that the application has significant hardcoded path issues that affect security, maintainability, and localization. Immediate attention is required for security vulnerabilities, followed by systematic refactoring of the configuration management system.
